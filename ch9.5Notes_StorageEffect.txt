# 9.5 Storage effect
Develop a two-species example of the storage effect, in which you manipulate both (i) fitness differences, and (ii) environmental variation. Show how these interact to determine relative abundances of the two species.

# Notes:
- Successful species may be very good at colonizing open sites, or they may be very good at displacing other species from a given site. These two extremes setup the basic tradeoff
surface, wherein species coexist when they make this tradeoff in a manner in which none of them have too superior a combination of both traits.
- We explored the basis of this model back in our chapter on metapopulation dynamics. Simlarly, here we focus on the case where the state variable is the proportion of available sites, rather than N.
- Here we represent the proportion of sites occupied by each of two species, where p i is the proportion of available sites occupied by species i, and c i and m i are the per capita colonizing and mortality rates of species i. Note that m is some combination of inherent senescense plus a background disturbance rate; we will refer to these simply as mortality.
- In addition to the trivial equilibrium (p ∗ 2 = 0), we see that the nontrivial equilibrium depends on the equilibrium of species 1. This equilibrium makes intuitive sense, in that species 2 cannot occupy sites already occupied by species 1, and like species one is limited by its own mortality and colonization rates (−m 2 /c 2 ). It is also reduced by a bit due to those occasions when both species colonize the same site ((c 1 /c 2 )p 1 ), but only species 1 wins.
- What parallels can you immediately draw between the equilibrium for the two species? The form of the equilibrium is quite similar, but with two additions for species 2. The numerator of the correction term includes its own mortality, just like species 1, but its mortality is adjusted downward (reduced) by the mortality of species 1. Thus the greater the mortality rate of species 1, greater is the opportunity for species 2. This term is also adjusted upward by the colonizing ability of species 1; the greater species 1’s colonizing ability, the more frequently it lands on and excludes (immediately) species 2, causing a drop in species 2’s equilibrium abundance. In order to focus on the competition–colonization trade-off, it is common to assume mortality is the same for both species. Tradeoffs with regard to martality may also be quite important, especially if high mortality is correlated with high colonization rate, and negatively correlated with
competitive ability.
- What if all of this is wrong? What if none of these tradeoffs underlie coexistance?
Jim Clark and his colleagues [31] examined dispersal traits of co-occurring deciduous forest trees (fecundity, dispersal), and successional status, and found no evidence that early successional species had higher dispersal capacity. This suggests a lack of support for competition–colonization tradeoffs. Rather, they found evidence that asynchronous success in reproduction of these long-lived organisms allowed them to coexist. Together, these traits constitute a mechanism referred to as the storage effect [28, 217].
- In the storage effect, competing species can store energy for reproduction
until favored conditions arise [28, 217]. Assumptions include:
--> Variable environment Each species encounters both favorable and unfavorable periods for reproduction.
--> Buffered population growth Each species stores energy in a resistant stage (e.g., long lived adults, seeds, spores, eggs) between favorable periods.
--> Environment–competition covariation The same conditions that favor reproduction for a particular species also increase competition intensity for that species. If, for instance, winter rains favor a particular desert annual, that desert annual will experience the greatest intraspecific competition following a wet winter precisely because of its large population size.
- By specifying greater specialization and greater spread between the environmental optima of the species pair in the second model, we have reduced niche overlap (Fig. 9.10a). Overlap in this model is the area under both species fitness-independent response curves. Note that large differences in overall fitness can alter effective overlap described by the density-independent reproductive rate, E i,t (Fig. 9.10b).
- The storage effect is an example of temporal niche differentiation. It depends on differential responses to the environment, buffered population growth, and covariation between competition intensity and population size.
