##(c) Consider which factor is more important in influencing outbreak interval. How do you measure the interval? What criteria would you use to determine “importance”? How do the realities of age and duration influence your selection of criteria? Write a short essay that asserts a thesis, and then provides support based on this exercise.

The most important fact in influencing outbreak intervals is likely age, due to the relative imbalance in densities of SIR individuals over time. The periodicity of outbreaks in populations is significantly affected by age of onset, such that oscillations begin to disappear as the onset age approaches average life span. Furthermore, the density of infected individuals is reduced to zero, while infected resistant densities decrease and susceptible densities increase. This indicates that diseases that affect older age groups are less persistent in populations over time.

On the other hand, the duration of a disease has the effect of damping oscillations in SIR densities. As the duration of a disease increases, the densities of each SIR population subset is brought to a balance. The periodicity of the oscillations are increased as well, allowing for a more balanced distribution of densities. This is because the population quickly becomes resistant to the disease.
