* Parameters *
Parameters of the continuous 2 species Lotka-Volterra competition model:
• r_i
Instantaneous rate of increase;
 intrinsic rate of growth;
 individuals produced per individual per unit time.
• α_ii
Intraspecific density dependence; intraspecific competition coefficient;
 the negative effect of an individual of species i on its own growth rate.
• α_ij
Interspecific density dependence; interspecific competition coefficient;
 the effect of interspecific competition; the negative effect that an individual of species j has on the growth rate of species i.
• K_i
1/α_ii ; carrying capacity of species i;
 the population size obtainable by species i in the absence of species j.
• α′_ij
α_ij/α_ii ;
 the relative importance of interspecific competition.
• β_ij
α_ij/α_jj ;
 the invasion criterion for species i; the relative importance of interspecific competition; the importance of the effect of species j on species i relative to the effect of species j on itself; see sec. 5.3.5.

* Chapter Summary *
• We can represent species effects on each other in precisely the same way we represented their effects on themselves.
• Considering only two species, species i can invade species j when the effect of species j on species i is less than its effect of species j on itself.
• Two species coexist stably when their effects on each other are smaller than their effects on themselves.
• The dominant eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix (perturbation growth rate), and its negative inverse, return time, are useful mathematical definitions of stability.
• Perturbation growth rate decreases as β_ij, β_ji decrease, and are either both less than one or both greater than 1 (β_ij = α_ij/α_jj).
• The magnitude of perturbation growth rate increases with r.

* Problems *
** 5.1 Basics **
Let α_11 = α_22 = 0.1, α_12 = 0.05, α_21 = 0.01
(a) Determine (N_1)^∗, (N_2)^∗, K_1, K_2
-> See code
(b) Draw (by hand, or in R) the ZNGIs (zero net growth isoclines); include arrows that indicate trajectories, and label the axes.
-> See code
(c) Select other values for the α and repeat (a) and (b); swap your answers with a friend, and check each other’s work.
-> See code
(d) Start with equilibria for competing species, and show algebraically that when interspecific competition is nonexistent, species reach their carrying cappacities.
-> See equations 5.10 to 5.13
-> We can confirm that as interspecific competition intensity falls to zero (α_12 = α_21 = 0), each species reaches its own carrying capacity. That is, when putative competitors occupy sufficiently different niches and no longer compete, then they both reach their own carrying capacities.

** 5.2 **
Derive the expression for (N_1)^∗/(N_2)^∗
-> See equations 5.12 and 5.13
-> We see that the α determine completely (N_1)^∗ and (N_2)^∗
-> Note that this is not true for Lotka-Volterra systems with more than two species; such systems also depend on r_i

** 5.3 **
Show the derivations of the partial derivatives of dN_2/dt, with respect to N_2 and to N_1; begin with eq. 5.6
-> See equation 5.6

** 5.4 Total community size **
Assume for convenience that α_11 = α_22 and α_12 = α_21, and let N_T = N_1 + N_2
(a) Write (N_T)^∗ as a function of α_11, α_22, α_12, α_21
-> See code
(b) Describe in words how N_T varies as α_ij varies from α_ii → 0.
(c) Graph (by hand, or in R) the relation between N_T versus α_ij. Let α ii = 0.01.
-> See code

** 5.5 **
Interpret the Routh-Hurwitz criterion in terms of species relative inter- and intraspecific competitive abilities
-> Note: In addition to the dominant eigenvalue, we need to consider the other eigenvalues. Table 5.2 provides a summary for interpreting eigenvalues with respect to the dynamics of the system. The eigenvalues depend upon elements of the Jacobian, and values calculated from the elements, notably the determinant, the trace, and the discriminant; a similar set of rules of system behavior can be based upon these values. For instance, the Routh-Hurwitz criterion for stability tells us that a two-species equilibrium will be locally stable, only if J_11 + J_22 < 0 and if J_11*J_22 − J_12*J_21 > 0. 
-> The addative effects of intraspecific competition needs to be declining for a two-species equilibrium to be locally stable.
-> And the difference between the joint effects of intra- compared to interspecific competition needs to be increasing. In other words, the total effect of interspecific competition needs to be less than the total effect of intraspecific competition.

** 5.6 The Jacobian matrix **
Here we turn words into math. Note that this is one way of making our assumptions very precise and clear. In each case below (a.–d.), (i) use algebraic inequalities between the βs and between the αs to show what the assumptions imply for the equalities and inequalities with respect to all αs, (ii) use these inequalities to simplify the Jacobian matrix (eq. (5.21) as much as possible, (iii) show algebraically how these (in)equalities determine the sign of each element
of the Jacobian, and (iv) explain in words how the magnitudes of the Jacobian elements determine stability properties.
(a) Assume that both species are functionally equivalent, and intraspecific competition is more intense than interspecific competition.
(b) Assume species are functionally equivalent and that each species has a greater impact on each other than they do on themselves.
(c) Assume species are functionally equivalent and interspecific competition is precisely equal to intraspecific competition.
(d) Assume species have the same carrying capacity, and can coexist, but that species 1 is dominant.
(e) Assume species 1 is the better competitor (note: this may have multiple interpretations).
(f) Assume species 1 and 2 are equivalent (note: this may have multiple interpretations).
