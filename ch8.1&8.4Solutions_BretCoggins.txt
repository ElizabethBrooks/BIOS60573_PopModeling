# 8.1 General
Compare and contrast the terms “alternate stable states” and “multiple basins of attraction.” Define each and explain how the terms are similar and how they differ.

Alternate stable states are a set of 2 or more possible stable attractors that can occur given single set of the same external environmental conditions. 

Multiple basins of attraction are a dynamic system of abundances where attractors may be hard to directly observe because of complex dynamics with long return times. 

These systems are often depicted as topographic maps where attractors are peaks and repellers are valleys. Alternate stable states can be thought of as simpler but more strictly defined examples of multiple basins of attraction where fixed stable states exist and are reachable after perturbation and where communities rapidly try to reach these stable states. More complicated dynamics in MBA evolution of traits moving attractors over time or saddles in competition models, will behave similarly, but probably more loosely than assumed under ASE condition. Regardless of the stringency of definition, initial conditions drive outcomes in these topographies.

# 8.4 Intraguild Predation
(a) Use Figure 8.8 to explain how initial abundances influence outcomes. Are there initial conditions that seem to result in all species coexisting? Are there things we should do to check this?

In intraguild predation, initial conditions determine the winner of competition and alone do not allow coexistence. In order to achieve stable coexistence, the worse competitor must be the predator and its attack rate and conversion efficiency will determine the outcome more than the starting conditions. 

(b) Explain how high attack rates and low conversion efficiencies by the top predator create alternate stable states.

High attack rates and low conversion efficiency do not promote stable coexistence because the predator would have too high of a negative impact on the prey and too little of a positive effect of the prey on the predator. Conversely, low attack rates and high conversion efficiency allow for coexistence.
